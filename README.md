    I have been collecting the best 'SAS" related posts from my  personal tips,
    COMP-SOFT-SYS-SAS, SAS-L, SAS FORUM, StackOverflow R, perl and python
    some for the last almost 40 years, Even the bitserve(ARPANET) days. I used to
    post entire tips file, but because of a threat
    of litigation  I had to pull all the tips off the web. I said I would remove
    any questionalble content but they would not
    provide the problematic tips.

    If you see something that interests you send me a request and I will post to SAS-L.

    There are bout 3,500 tips
